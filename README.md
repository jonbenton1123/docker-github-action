Group B Task 1

GitHub and Docker can be used together to automate the entire Docker creation and update process with every change committed to a repository. This is done by creating an automatic Workflow on the GitHub repository that connects with a DockerHub account and pushes everything needed (Dockerfile, essential files, etc.) to DockerHub for anyone to use.
